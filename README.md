## üöÄ About Me

üéì I  a **Junior front-end web developer** (specializing in **React Applications** and **Vue Applications**). Since May 2023, I have been working as a junior front-end developer for **VIIA Studio**, where my main tech stack is Vue/Next.js.

üë®‚Äçüíª Since 02/2023, I have been developing skills in **Vue**, **Nuxt** and **TypeScript** by completing **vueschool.io** courses. I've also finished the **Mastering Nuxt 3** course.

üë®‚Äçüíª Between 02/2022 - 12/2022 I participated in a 10-month **Full Stack Developer** Kodilla bootcamp , during which I created 3 large projects using JavaScript, React and NodeJS. During that course, each week, I met 1:1 with mentor for an hour of code review and pair programming. One of projetcs was an e-commerce group project, led by PM in Kanban methodology, with all aspects of commercial programming.

üë®‚Äçüíª I had experience as a project **manager on IT projects** (new online service for the [**Polish National Football Federation**](https://www.pzpn.pl)). I also worked as a copywriter.

üé∏ My main passion outside the world of tech is collecting **vinyl records** (I have around 300 LPs), **concert and festival tourism**.  Whenever I can, I pack my car and **travel** with my family to new places, escpecially mountains. We love **austrian Alps and lakes**. Last year I've started slow jogging - great way to move your bones when you spend a lot of time on debugging your code.
